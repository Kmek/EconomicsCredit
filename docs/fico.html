        <h2>What is a FICO score?</h2>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="box full">
    <p>A FICO score is a credit score, which is a number between 300-850 that is determined using the Fair Isaac Corporation scoring system. Everyone who has a credit history has a credit score. This higher this number is, the more trustworthy and "money-smart" the borrower is. Because of this, higher credit score owners will get better offers from lenders, because they have proven they can manage their money and pay back their loans. Credit scores are not only checked when you apply for a credit card, they're checked any time you apply to borrow money. Credit scores are mainly calculated based off of your payment history, total amount owed, length of credit history, types of credit, and new credit.</p>

        <h2>How do credit cards help / harm your credit score?</h2>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="box full">
    <p>If you are a revolver and you don't pay off your outstanding balance every month, credit cards can hurt your credit score. If you are a deadbeat and you consistently pay off your outstanding balance every month, then credit cards can help improve your credit score. It really depends on how you handle your borrowed money. Always paying your bills on time helps raise your credit score, and missing payments or late fees can hurt your credit. Basically, if you budget your money, you are showing that you are a trustworthy borrower, so your credit score will increase to reflect this. But if you show that you cannot handle a credit card and you instead carelessly gain debt, your credit score will change to reflect this as well.</p>
