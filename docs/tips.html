    <h3>Make Payments On Time</h3>
    <p>if you miss a payment, then you can be struck with late fees, which require you to pay more money than if you had just paid your payment on time. Late and missed payments also show up on your credit report and can even lower your credit score. It's best to just pay everything on time.</p>

    <h3>Pay More Than The Minimum</h3>
    <p>It's tempting to just pay the minimum payment rather than the whole outstanding balance on a card. But if you are unable to pay your entire outstanding balance on your card, at least pay more than the minimum payment. If you always only pay the minimum payment, then it can take years to pay off a credit card, and overall the interest will grow to be more than the original outstanding debt was worth. It's best to pay as much of the outstanding balance as you can on a credit card at the end of each month to keep your debt down.</p>

    <h3>Know What You Signed Up For</h3>
    <p>It's best to fully read the credit card customer agreement and account opening disclosures so you know what you signed up for. You should be aware of all fees you have to pay as well as any other fees you might encounter. You shouldn't have any surprises when it comes to your own credit card.</p>

    <h3>Double Check Your Monthly Statements</h3>
    <p>Sometimes billing mistakes happen, so to be aware of them you must read through your own monthly statement. This also gives you the chance to look over all of your purchases each month, so if something looks suspicious you can let your bank know as soon as possible.</p>

    <h3>Stay Below Your Credit Limit</h3>
    <p>Your credit limit is how much credit card companies will allow you to borrow using your credit card. If you go over this amount, you could encounter extra fees. Regularly using high percentages of your line of credit can also affect your credit score. According to CapitalOne, experts suggest that you should stay below 30% of your credit limit to maintain a good credit score. </p>
