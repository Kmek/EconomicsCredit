        <h3>Annual Fee</h3>
        <p>An annual fee is a fee that some credit card companies require you to pay just for having the card. This fee can go all the way to $100. If possible, you want to find a credit card that has no annual fee, or one that has a very low annual fee. It is also important to read through the application fully, as some companies won't start charging you an annual fee until after your first year.</p>

        <h3>APR (Annual Percentage Rate)</h3>
        <p>The APR is the interest rate on the card, and it can vary from 11% to 30%. Sometimes companies offer teaser introductory rates that go up to a higher APR once you miss a payment. If you do not pay off your outstanding balance at the end of each month in full, then this balance will start to grow more debt on the card through the added interest. You should look for a low APR, but the best way to avoid high interest rates is to be a deadbeat and pay off your cards at the end of each month.</p>

        <h3>Other Fees</h3>
        <p>Before signing up for a credit card, you should know all the fees you will have to pay, as well as any fees that might arise, such as late fees for missing a payment. Other fees may include balance transfer fees, cash advance fees, foreign transaction fees, and over the limit fees. If these extra fees are extremely high, then you don't want that credit card.</p>

        <h3>Credit Limit</h3>
        <p>The credit limit is the line of credit out can borrow from the credit card company. This varies, and it depends heavily on whether credit card companies think you are a safe investment or not. If you have a low credit score or no credit history, then you will probably be offered a small credit limit. Your credit limit really depends on what you want to use the credit card for. If you're intending to pay off your balance at the end of each month to build up your credit score, then a small line of credit will probably do just fine. If you're looking to pay for an expensive purchase over time, then you want a large line of credit to accommodate the given purchase.</p>

        <h3>Rewards</h3>
        <p>Rewards vary from each credit card company. These really depend on what you're interested in, so if you like to travel then look for a card that offers airline miles. Other rewards can include cash back, hotel stays, or even gift cards. To get the most out of these rewards, it's important that you pay off your outstanding balance in full each month, else you will be accumulating debt that will most likely outweigh whatever "rewards" you receive. It is also important to note that you should focus on comparing the fees, APRs, and credit limits of credit cards, not the rewards the cards come with, as rewards are just extra benefits.</p>

<div class="box full">
    <p>Credit card companies are required to show you information about their credit cards before you sign anything. This information must be presented in a table called a Schumer Box, which includes info like annual fees, APR, and late fees. This box makes it easy to compare different credit cards, so you know what you are signing up for. But the Schumer Box is not a substitute for reading through the contract that credit card companies put forward, as you should always know what you are signing up for. </p>
