        <h2>Similarities</h2>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <p>Both debit cards and credit cards can carry major credit card company logos, like Visa or MasterCard. Both card types can also be used to make purchases at stores by swiping the card. Both sometimes ask for a PIN (personal identification number) or a signature for purchases. </p>

        <h2>Debit Cards</h2>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <p>The main difference between debit cards and credit cards is where the purchase is charged to. Debit cards use money directly from the owner's checking account. This card is simply for accessing the customer's own money, so it's easier to make purchases than writing a check every time. The card could also come with an overdraft line of credit, just to protect the customer against overspending. Debit cards can also be used to withdraw cash, since the money comes from the customer's own funds. Instead of being attached to an account, debit cards can also come in prepaid form. This means that money is initially loaded onto the card, and it can be used like a regular card until the money runs out. </p>

        <h2>Credit Cards</h2>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <p>Credit cards use a line of credit, the amount of which is determined by the credit card company. If the customer tries to use more than their given line of credit, the card will be declined. Credit card purchases are added to the customer's outstanding balance. If this outstanding balance is not paid off, interest starts to grow. If not careful, this can collect and become larger than the original purchases were worth. Through credit card debt, banks make their money.The best way to avoid gaining debt from a credit card is to fully pay off the outstanding balance at the end of each month, to prevent interest from ever accumulating. </p>
