    <p>Standard credit cards are regular credit cards. They have a strict spending limit, as in their line of credit. They offer a minimum payment at the end of each month, so the user can choose to pay off their outstanding balance or not. If the outstanding balance is not paid in full at the end of each month, then high interest rates start to accumulate debt. Credit cards usually come with either low or no annual fees. These standard cards are widely accepted, so they can be used at most stores. Credit cards are sometimes offered to users with low credit scores, as banks hope they can profit off of generated debt. </p>

        <h2>Charge Cards</h2>

<div class="box full">
    <p>Charge cards are different. They must be paid off in full at the end of every month, no exceptions. This also means that there are no high interest rates on charge cards, as users don't have the option of putting off their debt and letting it grow. Because banks still want to profit off of charge cards, these cards tend to have high annual fees. There is no spending limit on charge cards, since the user must pay back what they charge to the card. These cards usually require very good credit, as the bank must trust that the user will pay off their outstanding balance. Because this type of card is more selective it is not as commonly accepted as standard credit cards are. Currently, only American Express offers charge cards.</p>
