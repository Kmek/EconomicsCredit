    <p>As soon as you notice that your credit card is missing or stolen, you should notify your credit card company. The best way to know this is to monitor your monthly reports, so you'll know if something wasn't purchased by you. The credit card company can put a hold on the credit card, which, if done early enough, can prevent any fraudulent purchases from going through. The early notification can also give your credit card company time to determine if & where fraud has occurred. They can also remove these charges from your account. If needed, your credit card company even has the power to close your credit card account to prevent any more unauthorized charges, so you can be issued a fresh new credit card and number.</p>

        <h2>What are you liable for?</h2>

<div class="box full">
    <p>According to Investopedia, United States federal law limits the liability of cardholders to just $50. This means that regardless of how much was spent unauthorized with your card, you will only have to pay a maximum of $50. If just the credit card number was stolen instead of the physical card itself, then federal law grants the cardholder zero liability to the credit card company, so the cardholder wouldn't have to pay anything. Many credit card companies are also adopting this zero liability policy for all fraudulent charges, even if the physical card was stolen. Because of policies like these, cardholders can feel safe knowing that their money is insured.</p>
